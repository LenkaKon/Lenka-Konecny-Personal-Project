Lenka-Konecny-Personal-Project
==============================

Develop a small personal project, which demonstrates something new you've learned.

For my personal project I created a platform for the executive board members of the Accounting & Financial Women’s Alliance (AFWA) using a free, online toolkit called Wiggio.  This platform will allow everything we need, as board members, to be in one place.  It is so simple and easy to use that even our less tech-savvy members will be able to utilize and benefit from it.  It provides absolutely everything we need to work productively as a group, and will allow us to connect, collaborate, and engage in new ways.  I’m very excited to present Wiggio and all its features at our next board meeting so we can implement it ASAP!
